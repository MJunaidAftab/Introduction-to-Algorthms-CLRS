    "Note that it suffices to show that the element at node $(n/2)$ has either a left or a right child and that the elemenet at node $(n/2) + 1$ has no child. Noting that $n - 2 < 2(n/2) \\leq n$ implies that the element at node $(n/2)$ has a left child. The inequalities above also imply that the left child is the element at either node $n - 1$ or $n$. In the first case, we see that the element at elemenet at node $(n/2)$ has a right child as well and the element at node $(n/2) + 1$ has no child as all elements in the array have been exhausted. In the second case, elemenet at node $(n/2)$ has no right child and consequently the element at node $(n/2) + 1$ doesn't have a child as well. This proves the claim."

    "## Priority Queue\n",
    "\n",
    "A priority queue acts like a queue in that items remain in it for some time before being dequeued. However, in a priority queue the logical order of items inside a queue is determined by their “priority”. Specifically, the highest priority items are retrieved from the queue ahead of lower priority items.\n",
    "\n",
    "<font color='red'>Hence this implies that the elements in the binary heap are arranged in order such that the element stored at the top of the heap is given the most priority and so on.</font>\n",
    "\n",
    "There are mainly 4 operations we want from a priority queue:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<font color='red'>Insert:</font> To insert a new element in the queue. The running time is $(\\lg n)$ as it references the function used to implement the <font color='red'>Increase/Decrease key\n",
    "</font> attribute of the priority queue.\n",
    "\n",
    "<font color='red'>Maximum/Minimum:</font> To get the maximum and the minimum element from the max-priority queue and min-priority queue respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "<font color='red'>Extract Maximum/Minimum:</font> To remove and return the maximum and the minimum element from the max-priority queue and min-priority queue respectively. The running time is $O(\\lg n)$ as over here we utilize the MAX-HEAPIFY function which runs in $O(\\lg n)$ time.\n",
    "\n",
    "<font color='red'>Increase/Decrease key:</font> To increase or decrease key of any element in the queue. The complexity of this step is $O(\\lg n)$ as we simply traverse along the binary heap tree which can be done in $O(\\lg n)$ time as the height of the tree is of order $\\lg n$.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, we can build a priority queue in $(\\lg n)$ time.\n",
