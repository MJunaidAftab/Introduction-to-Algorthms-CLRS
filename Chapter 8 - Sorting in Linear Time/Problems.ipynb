    "There are $n!$ possible permutations of the input array assuming all input elements are distinct. Each permutation is in a different leaf since the algorithm needs to perfectly distinguish between two distinct permutations Since each permutation is equally likely, so, each occurs with probability $\\frac{1}{n!}$.\n",

    "The depths of particular elements of in the left and right subtrees are all one less than their depths when considered elements of the original tree. Also the left and right subtrees form a partition of all the leaves of the decision tree. This effectively proves the statement.\n",

    "Suppose we have a decision tree with $k$ leaves. If $i$ is the number of leaves in the left subtree, we have $D(T) = D(LT) + D(RT) + k$. Now take the minimum value of $D(T)$ over all decision trees to yield the desired result.\n",

    "Select a red jug. Compare it to blue jugs until you find one which matches. Set that pair aside, and repeat for the next red jug.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Part (b)\n",
    "\n",
    "We can imagine first lining up the red jugs in some order. Then a solution to this problem becomes a permutation of the blue jugs such that the iith blue jug is the same size as the iith red jug. As in section 8.1, we can make a decision tree which represents comparisons made between blue jugs and red jugs. An internal node represents a comparison between a specific pair of red and blue jugs, and a leaf node represents a permutation of the blue jugs based on the results of the comparison. We are interested in when one jug is greater than, less than, or equal in size to another jug, so the tree should have 33 children per node.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Part (c)\n",
    "\n",
    " We use an algorithm analogous to randomized quicksort. Select a blue jug at random. Partition the red jugs into those which are smaller than the blue jug, and those which are larger. At some point in the comparisons, you will find the red jug which is of equal size. Once the red jugs have been divided by size, use the red jug of equal size to partition the blue jugs into those which are smaller and those which are larger. If $k$ red jugs are smaller than the originally chosen jug, we need to solve the original problem on input of size $k − 1$ and size $n − k$, which we will do in the same manner. \n",
