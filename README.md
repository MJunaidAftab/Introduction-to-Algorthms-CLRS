# CLRS-Solutions

This repository contains implementations of some algorithms and data structures and solutions to (some) problems and exercises in the textbook Introduction to Algorithms by Thomas Cormen, Charles Leiserson, Ronald Rivest and Stein. I have used Jupyter Notebooks to implement the algorithms and data structures in Python. 

As I continue working through the textbook at my own pace, I expected to add updated Python notebooks for the correspionding sections and/or chapters accordingly.
